# UPDATED
# Adding Routes
# Now we need to configure routes for the controllers that have been created. config/routes.rb should be edited to match the following:
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users,
             controllers: {
                 sessions: 'users/sessions',
                 registrations: 'users/registrations'
             }
  get '/test', to: 'test#show'
end


# ORIGINAL
# Rails.application.routes.draw do
#   devise_for :users
#   # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
# end
